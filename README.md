# CISC 204 Modelling Project - Group 29
The goal of this project is to assess the best movie choice a group of people could make, using constraints based on factors related to the potential movie choices and the group. The idea demonstrates the use of a model that is similar to those used for watch recommendations made by platforms such as Netflix and YouTube.

## Structure

* `documents`: Contains folders for both of your draft and final submissions. README.md files are included in both.
* `run.py`: General wrapper script that you can choose to use or not. Only requirement is that you implement the one function inside of there for the auto-checks.
* `test.py`: Run this file to confirm that your submission has everything required. This essentially just means it will check for the right files and sufficient theory size.
